# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

- What was your motivation?

My motivation was hability of proving myself that i was able to complete it and do it with success.
I wanted to test myself and make something easier to review the information.
It solves the problem of reading everything.
Because the most important information is sorted and easier to check.
Learned how to make a simple website, and how a website structure actually works, and shows me the hard work that is needed to actually make a web page.

Also if we use DevTools on brwoser and if we go to console we can see JavaScript running with a list of the topics we learned from prework and it will choose one topic for us to study first.
